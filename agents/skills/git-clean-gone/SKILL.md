# Git Clean Gone Branches

Clean up all git branches marked as [gone] (branches deleted on the remote but still exist locally), including removing associated worktrees.

## Step 1: List branches to identify any with [gone] status

```bash
git branch -v
```

Note: Branches with a '+' prefix have associated worktrees and must have their worktrees removed before deletion.

## Step 2: Identify worktrees that need to be removed for [gone] branches

```bash
git worktree list
```

## Step 3: Remove worktrees and delete [gone] branches

```bash
# Process all [gone] branches, removing '+' prefix if present
git branch -v | grep '\[gone\]' | sed 's/^[+* ]//' | awk '{print $1}' | while read branch; do
  echo "Processing branch: $branch"
  # Find and remove worktree if it exists
  worktree=$(git worktree list | grep "\\[$branch\\]" | awk '{print $1}')
  if [ ! -z "$worktree" ] && [ "$worktree" != "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" ]; then
    echo "  Removing worktree: $worktree"
    git worktree remove --force "$worktree"
  fi
  # Delete the branch
  echo "  Deleting branch: $branch"
  git branch -D "$branch"
done
```

## Expected Behavior

After executing these commands:

- See a list of all local branches with their status
- Identify and remove any worktrees associated with [gone] branches
- Delete all branches marked as [gone]
- Provide feedback on which worktrees and branches were removed

If no branches are marked as [gone], report that no cleanup was needed.
